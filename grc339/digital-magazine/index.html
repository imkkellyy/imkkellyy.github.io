            <h3>Third Generation; This Restaurant has Lived Through the Pandemic</h3>
            <p> A three-star Michelin chef is going out for dinner. Chef Chan Yan-tak and his four work buddies push through plastic door flaps and squeeze into a fluorescent-lit, Cantonese diner in Kowloon, Hong Kong.The middle-aged men keep their winter jackets over their tees to shield them from the city’s wet winter chill, but their cheeks redden as the whiskey gets flowing from the bottle kept for them on the shelf. When another regular recognizes Chan, he comes over and greets him with a shot of rice wine. </p>

            <h3>Less Than $10 A Bowl - Sashimi Bowl</h3>
            <p> Poke bowls are like sushi’s flashier cousin and the Low Key Poke Joint in Fremont is taking it to another level. The best part is they’re under $10. A regular-sized poke bowl will run you around $8.99 with all the trimmings. Although, like Chipotle, “guac” or, in this case, avocado, will run you extra. Still, only a dollar more for avocado is well worth it and it remains under $10. </p>
